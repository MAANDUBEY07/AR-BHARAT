This Kolam uses a square dot grid with 6 rows and 6 columns, spacing 40 units. It exhibits approximately 4-fold rotational symmetry and 2 reflection axes. Pattern style: traditional; complexity: basic-rect-loop. Culturally, similar motifs are common in Tamil Nadu (demo), often associated with daily thresholds and festive occasions. Mathematically, Kolams demonstrate geometry, symmetry, and recursion through repeated motifs around dot lattices.
